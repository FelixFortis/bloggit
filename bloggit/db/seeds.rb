        STOCKTON, CA—Concluding proceedings of a case that will now be sent 
		to a jury it lacked the means to properly vet, San Joaquin District 
		Attorney James Willett told reporters Monday that he believes his 
		office prosecuted a suspected murderer to the fullest extent of its 
		budget. “I can assure the public we used all of the very limited 
		resources at our disposal to build this case,” said Willett, adding 
		that his underpaid colleagues never rested as they attempted to make 
		up for the recent layoffs of their legal assistants. “From day one we 
		worked around the clock combing through whatever evidence had not been 
		rendered inadmissible by the shoddy work of our overburdened, 
		understaffed police force. Then we determined the maximum charges we 
		could bring and settled on something lesser to ensure we got a 
		conviction and avoided completely squandering our department’s meager 
		funding.” Willett confirmed that he is confident the jury will put the 
		suspect behind bars until whenever prison overcrowding forces the state 
		to grant an early release.

        ATLANTA—Speaking up on behalf of his six-person group at Morrie’s Tavern 
		& Grill Tuesday evening, software engineer Bradley McCray reportedly took 
		it upon himself to order a wide selection of appetizers totaling 
		approximately $40. “Yeah, let’s get two loaded potato skins, a plate of 
		habanero poppers, and a few baskets of chips and guac for the table,” McCray 
		was overheard telling the waitress, neglecting to consult the other members 
		of his party before committing them to the large assortment of pre-dinner 
		fare. “Are the regular or chipotle hot wings better? You know, how about 
		you just bring us one of each? And we’re also gonna start off with a pitcher 
		of strawberry margaritas to share.” At press time, the rest of the table was 
		watching helplessly as McCray asked to see the dessert menu.

        SANTA CLARITA, CA—After turning 29 last week, local single woman Denise Palermo 
		reportedly took the opportunity Tuesday to reflect on her current lack of long-term 
		relationship prospects and slash several more items from the continually shrinking 
		list of qualities she desires in a romantic partner.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Well, it’s time to lower the bar again,” said Palermo, referring to the minimum 
		personal, professional, and financial characteristics she looks for in the men 
		she dates. “Full head of hair—that’s got to go. Being well-read has been on the 
		chopping block for years, so it’s probably time to get rid of that one. Ditto on 
		him being a great conversationalist, being taller than me, liking the Decemberists, 
		and not taking himself too seriously.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Come to think of it, my upper age limit has been 40 for a while,” Palermo added. 
		“Maybe now’s a good time to go ahead and bump that up to 45.”
	</p>
	<p>
		According to sources, Palermo’s checklist, which as recently as 2007 included more 
		than 38 specifically ranked physical, emotional, and intellectual attributes, has 
		been cut down by more than two-thirds since her teenage years, when her image of 
		the ideal boyfriend was at its zenith.
	</p>
	<p>
		Priorities that once occupied top slots, such as having good teeth, a love of 
		international travel, and individually defined abdominal muscles, were long ago 
		demoted in importance, and are now said to be considered perks, though they are 
		by no means requirements for Palermo to date someone.
	</p>
	<p>
		“I used to say I’d only ever consider getting involved with a professional, ideally 
		a doctor, but then as I got a little older it was anyone with a bachelor’s degree, 
		and now, honestly, any guy who holds down a steady job can make the cut,” said 
		Palermo, noting that lack of full-time employment as a deal-breaker is scheduled 
		for removal by 2019. “He doesn’t even need to own his own place or like the outdoors, 
		criteria that were removed from the list in 2011 and 2012, respectively.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“I will say, though, that a love of dogs is still very important to me,” Palermo 
		continued. “That one’s got at least another two years left in it.”
	</p>
	<p>
		This latest trimming of Palermo’s list comes after similar purges on birthdays in 2002, 
		2003, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and last year, when she reluctantly struck off her 
		long-held prohibition against dating smokers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though she acknowledged the nonnegotiable traits she absolutely insists upon are 
		few—namely wanting to have kids someday, not being overtly religious, and maintaining 
		a basic, minimal level of physical fitness—Palermo said she often wonders whether 
		there might still be a lot of compatible partners out there she isn’t giving a chance to.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Sometimes I think maybe it’s unreasonable for me to have these expectations,” said 
		Palermo, admitting that lately she has come to terms with dating men who “don’t have 
		much in the way of a sense of humor.” “Maybe there are a lot of good guys out there 
		who don’t listen to music or read more than a book a year. I guess I could figure 
		out how to be okay with that.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Because really, when you get down to it, there are only two things that are important: 
		that a guy is attracted to me and that he isn’t currently dating someone else,” 
		Palermo continued. “I haven’t had to cross those off. Yet.”

        QUINCY, MA—Local man Alex Heard told reporters Thursday that he was thoroughly confused 
		after receiving a compliment from an acquaintance despite the fact that he could in no 
		way advance this individual’s career or assist him professionally whatsoever. “I think 
		Mike [Dawes] knows that I don’t have any pull at my office, so I’m not sure what his 
		angle is here,” said Heard, adding that he was at a complete loss to come up with 
		another ulterior motive Dawes may have had for his praise. “We actually work in 
		completely different fields, and he’s never expressed any interest in doing my type of 
		work before, so it just doesn’t make any sense that he’d say something like that. I mean, 
		who knows? Maybe he meant it.” At press time, Heard had returned home to find a LinkedIn 
		invitation from Dawes waiting in his inbox.
